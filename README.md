### Disclaimer
Unfortunetely I am still working on optimalization of GetImageData/PutImageData which is causing all the trouble with performance drop when enemies start shooting multiple missiles but it is still main part of my shield collision mechanic.
I am aware that canvas is not ideal for this project but it was not my choice - I made this game as a school project and it required using canvas. Despite performance issues I still believe that my game might be enjoyable for someone :).
